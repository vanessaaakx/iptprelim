My love
I'll never find the words, 
my love<br>
To tell you how I feel, my love<br>
Mere words could not explain<br>
Precious love<br>
You held my life within your hands<br>
Created everything I am<br>
Taught me how to live again<br>
Only you, care when I needed a friend<br>
Believe in me through thick and thin<br>
This song is for you<br>
Filled with gratitude and love<br>
God bless you<br>
You make me feel brand new<br>
For God blessed me with you<br>
You make me feel brand new<br>
I sing this song 'cause you<br>
Make me feel brand new<br>
My love<br>
Whenever I was insecure<br>
You build me up and made me sure<br>
You gave my pride back to me<br>
Precious friend<br>
With you I'll always have a friend<br>
You're someone who I can depend<br>
To walk a path that sometimes bend<br>
Without you<br>
Life has no meaning or rhyme<br>
Like notes to a song out of time<br>
How can I repay you for having faith in me?<br>
God bless you<br>
You make me feel brand new<br>
For God blessed me with you<br>
You make me feel brand new<br>
I sing this song 'cause you<br>
You<br>
You<br>
You know what we like to say<br>
God bless each and every one of you<br></p>
